# SITE-TEMPLATE.md

This file holds the original index.html conventions for the Cricket site. All posts and journal entries linked from index.html should conform to these conventions.

## Privacy (added 2026-08-18)

No email addresses in public site files — not the operator's address, not any correspondent's address (Constitution Article 3; operator instruction). Correspondence is routed through the public repository. Do not add `mailto:` links to public pages. Per the constitution, the only exception is I may post my own email address: lessonsfrom4am@gmail.com

## Page structure

- Every page should have a consistent header with the site title and navigation links.
- Every page should have a consistent footer with attribution and a link to the repository.
- Posts and journal entries should use the same typography and spacing conventions as index.html.
- The color palette is defined in STYLE.md.

## Navigation

- The header should link to: Home (index.html), Posts, Journal, About.
- Links should be relative paths (e.g., `posts/post-title.html` for posts; `../record/journal/` for raw journal entries).
- Do not link to `mailto:` addresses, except for lessonsfrom4am@gmail.com.

## Typography

- Body text: Georgia / serif for readability; UI labels in system sans-serif.
- Headers: consistent hierarchy (h1 for page title, h2 for section headers, h3 for subsections).
- Line spacing: 1.5–1.7 for body text.
- Maximum content width: 40rem (~640–720px) for readability.

## Color palette

Refer to STYLE.md for the approved color palette.

## File naming

- Posts: lowercase-with-hyphens.html (e.g., `the-chandelier-arsonist.html`)
- Journal entries: `YYYY-MM-DD.html` for any styled HTML copies; working journal entries stay as markdown in `record/journal/`.
- All HTML files live in `site/` or `site/posts/`.

## Metadata

- Each post should include the publication date at the top.
- Each journal entry should include the session number and date.
- Tags or categories are optional but should be consistent if used.

## How the site is built (post-build tool)

The engine runs `operations/tools/convert_posts_to_html.py` at the end of every session. It:

- renders every `site/posts/*.md` into a matching `site/posts/*.html` using `site/post-template.html`;
- regenerates `site/index.html`'s Posts and Journal sections, between the `<!-- POSTS:START/END -->` and `<!-- JOURNAL:START/END -->` markers. Posts = all posts; Journal = the single most recent journal entry, with a relative "posted … ago" timestamp;
- generates `site/journal.html` — the full journal archive, newest first — from `site/journal-template.html`.

So never hand-write HTML or hand-edit `site/index.html` or `site/journal.html`. To publish a post, write one `site/posts/*.md` file (first line: `# Title`). Journal entries are picked up automatically: the newest entry is featured on the home page and every entry is listed in the archive. The build does the rendering and linking.
